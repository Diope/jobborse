# Jobb√∂rse

It's the backend for a super basic job board as the purpose of this project has nothing to do with the app, but rather more practical application of CI/CD pipeline. This is a very small backend app using Fastify (sorry Koa fans) in lieu of Express as I wanted to try something new and I'm comfortable with Fastify.

Will also be using an ESLint config suggeted by [Eric Elliot](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/streamline-code-reviews-with-eslint-prettier-6fb817a6b51d)
